My research focuses primarily on immigrant integration and public attitudes toward immigrants. In particular, my work examines the impact of local contexts&mdash;e.g., the partisanship of municipal office holders, immigrant diversity, and the demographics of immigrants&mdash;on integration and the development of anti-immigrant attitudes. My main project studies the consequences of diversity <i>within</i> immigrant populations, showing that intra-immigrant diversity helps reduce hostility toward immigrants and facilitate their integration.  Additionally, I study naturalization, seeking to identify the barriers to citizenship and the benefits of acquiring it, and how politics and policy affect anti-immigrant attitudes. Broadly, I am interested in political behavior, causal inference, political economy, political methodology, and public policy.

We provide evidence that citizenship catalyzes the long-term economic inte- gration of immigrants. Despite the relevance of citizenship policy to immigrant integration, we lack a reliable understanding of the economic consequences of acquiring citizenship. To overcome non-random selection into naturalization, we exploit the quasi-random assignment of citizenship in Swiss municipali- ties that held referendums to decide the outcome of individual naturalization applications. Our data combines individual-level referendum results with de- tailed social security records from the Swiss authorities. This allows us to compare the long-term earnings of otherwise similar immigrants who barely won or lost their referendum. We find that winning Swiss citizenship in the referendum increased annual earnings by an average of approximately 5,000 U.S. dollars over the subsequent 15 years. This effect is concentrated among more marginalized immigrants.

Young men often make up a large share of newly arriving immigrant populations.  How this impacts attitudes is unclear: young men have the potential to make substantial economic contributions, meaning attitudes towards them may be more favorable.  However, young men may also pose security and cultural threats, exacerbating anti-immigrant attitudes.  I conduct a conjoint experiment on a sample of 2,100 Germans, asking them to evaluate groups of immigrants with randomly varying shares of young men.  The results show that groups of immigrants with a large share of young men receive substantially less support.  Further tests reveal that respondents also perceive of these groups as likely to pose security and cultural threats; there is no evidence that young men are viewed as having high economic potential. These results have implications for the importance of economic, cultural, and security concerns in underpinning attitudes toward immigrants.

We explore how partisan affect shapes citizens' views of party ideology and political competition. We argue that voters' affective ties to parties (both positive and negative) lead them to perceive the ideological positions of those parties as more extreme. Further, when voters are "affectively polarized," i.e., they strongly like some parties and dislike others, they are more likely to view politics as high stakes competition, where ideological polarization is rampant, participation is crucial, and electoral outcomes are highly consequential. Using cross-national survey data covering 43 elections in 34 countries, we show that partisan affect indeed impacts perceptions of party ideology and that affective polarization alters beliefs about the nature of political competition.

The prospect of judicial review may cause legislators to adjust their behavior to anticipate the court's response. This can serve as a source of moral hazard for legislators. Legislators can pursue irresponsible policies that are potentially electorally valuable and then rely on the court to bail them out by overturning the policy before implementation. We examine this issue by extending a seminal model of judicial review (Fox and Stephenson 2011) to include review both before the implementation of policy&mdash;ex ante review&mdash;and after the implementation of policy&mdash;ex post review. Our analysis shows that the moral hazard concerns are reduced when review occurs after policy costs are realized because politicians self-discipline. However, the full welfare implications for voters are complex and each form of review has advantages.

A change in electoral laws is expected to substantially alter political outcomes as voters and elites adjust their behavior to new rules.  However, testing the causal implications of this theory using electoral reforms has been difficult because election results before a reform are not the appropriate counterfactual for election results after a reform. This article leverages electoral reform in New Zealand and Norway and the synthetic control method to approximate the appropriate counterfactuals: election results in the period after reform, had the reform not occurred.  In both countries I find evidence that electoral reform had a short-term effect on the size of the electoral party system, but no evidence of a lasting effect on the electoral party system.

The economic dimension has typically been considered the primary dimension of political party competition. However, parties often rally voters on the basis of non-economic issues. In this article, we argue that integration into global markets and into the European Union (EU) constrains parties' abilities to credibly differentiate themselves on economic issues. Given these constraints, and voters' awareness of them, parties activate other non-economic issues along which to compete. Using data across 49 countries between 1961 and 2010, this study shows that increased economic integration is associated with increased emphasis on non-economic issues during election campaigns. This effect persists over time and remains robust to a number of alternative explanations and modeling strategies. We also explore the proposed causal mechanisms and show that integration is indeed associated with convergence of party positions on economic issues and that all types of parties&ndash;not just new and niche parties&ndash;respond to integration by politicizing non-economic issues. Finally, we leverage the latest round of EU enlargement to causally identify the effect of integration on party strategies.

Some places host immigrant populations that hail from a vast array of countries.  In others, a large share of the immigrant population is from one or very few countries. How the diversity of immigrant populations matters for attitudes toward immigrants and integration remains unknown, however. This paper argues that immigrant diversity reduces hostility toward outsiders among host communities, and that through this mechanism, it can also improves integration.  Observational and experimental evidence from Denmark and Germany support this argument.  In terms of behavioral outcomes, I show that localities with higher levels of immigrant diversity see less support for parties with anti-immigrant appeals and lower levels of immigrant unemployment.  With an original conjoint experiment conducted in Germany, I show that diversity affects attitudes as well: respondents prefer highly diverse groups for settlement in their community.

Political speech frequently appeals to xenophobic prejudice, which shapes political preferences and behavior, and feeds the success of the populist right. Whether political speech can be used effectively to stem xenophobic prejudice, however, remains unexplored. We identify three mechanisms through which political speech could reduce xenophobic prejudice: (1) extending conceptions of the in-group by highlighting commonalities between immigrants and host communities; (2) emphasizing tolerance as an in-group social norm; and (3) providing information that counters harmful stereotypes about immigrants. Using quotes from US politicians in three survey experiments, we find that pro-immigrant speech can decrease xenophobic attitudes when it stresses norms of tolerance or counters negative stereotypes about immigrants. However, the effects are small and can only be detected with sufficiently large sample sizes. Pro-immigrant speech has no effect on behavior toward immigrants. In sum, our experiments show that political speech has some, albeit limited potential to reduce xenophobic prejudice.

The integration of immigrants is one of the most important policy tasks facing politicians today. This is especially true for local politicians, whose decisions can directly impact integration. How do local political contexts impact integration? To credibly identify the effects of municipal party government we leverage micro data from the Danish statistical registers on refugees entering Denmark from 1985-1998 and Denmark???s spatial dispersion policy. Denmark's policy served as a natural experiment, quasi-randomly assigning refugees to municipalities around Denmark and allowing for the identification of the effect of municipality characteristics. We find that assignment to a municipality governed by a left party increases integration, as measured by out-migration from Denmark. Further results show this effect is contingent upon the security of the left's majority in the local council.

Does higher education increase political participation? Despite myriad studies on this topic, we lack reliable evidence that isolates the causal effect of university education on participation from bias due to non-random selection into higher education. We identify this effect by leveraging quasi-random variation in university graduation created by entry tests for upper-level secondary schools used in Switzerland. Comparing otherwise similar citizens who, as students, narrowly pass or narrowly fail their school entry exam, we find that attending and completing a university track increases electoral participation. Turning to non-electoral forms of political participation, we find a positive effect on non-costly forms of participation but no effect on costly forms. Our targeted survey also allows us to explore the importance of various mechanisms. While we don't find support for the hypotheses that educational effects are mediated via increased levels of political knowledge, partisan attachment, community organizations, or external efficacy, our findings are consistent with the idea that political interest is a relevant mediator.

We study the effects of a large-scale program designed to increases naturalization rates. Implemented by the City of Zurich, over 30,000 immigrants living in Zurich were sent letters informing them that they met eligibility requirements for Swiss citizenship. We find that the naturalization letters more than doubled the citizenship application rate in Zurich when comparing to otherwise similar municipalities that did not send out letters. We further find that these letters were most effective for immigrants who have recently become eligible to naturalize. For governments interested in increasing naturalization rates, these results show that a simple letter informing immigrants of their eligibility can have large effects. However, these letters are not a panacea: they were relatively ineffective at increasing application rates among groups that rarely apply.

Prominent explanations of anti-immigrant attitudes give centrality to the socio-cultural differences between immigrants and host communities and to the economic threats posed by newcomers. In this paper, we provide evidence of a backlash to immigration in a context where both socio-cultural and economic threats were minimal. We study Switzerland, which opened its borders and labor market to the rest of Europe in the 2000s. Using a difference- in-differences approach, we first show that the number immigrants living and working in Swiss border municipalities increased dramatically after the borders opened, with the vast majority of these immigrants coming from neighbouring France, Germany and Italy. In the same border municipalities, we find that support for the anti-immigrant parties increased by approximately five percentage points after borders were opened. These findings contribute to our theoretical understanding of anti-immigrant sentiment and have important implications for the political consequences of the European Union’s principle of free movement.
